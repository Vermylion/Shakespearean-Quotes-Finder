# Shakespearean Quotes Finder
An app designed to get, search, and copy quotations from any of Shakespeare's plays. Primarly designed to work when writing, it stays on top of the window and doesn't disappear when deselected. It's equally meant to be attached to the left side of the screen for easier use, but can be used normally too.

## Install
To get the app, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Vermylion/Shakespearian-Quotes-Finder/releases/tag/1.0) and click on `SHQuotesFinder.exe` to download it.

Alternatively, you can also download the repository (In the dropdown menu of **<> Code**, select **Download ZIP**), getting access to the `.exe` and the `.py` file.

**Windows will say this app is a virus. It isn't. Trust me.**

## Use
Using the app is quite easy and a simple process, but a guide can never hurt.

### **TO KNOW: If you click on the quote, it copies it. All you have to do is paste it into your document.**

Once the app is launched, select the play you want in the top dropdown menu.
Once selected, press the **Go**. It will load that play into the app. If you ever want to change plays, just reselect and press **Go** again.

Once the play is loaded, you get access to the selection of characters and scenes. The very first option in each dropdown menu is **blank**; it designated **all of the options** in that dropdown menu.
If/when you have selected the character's quote you want, and in what scene (or the whole play), press **Search** to display all of the quotes that character says in that scene.

You can also search quotes based on key words. By entering whatever key word you wish to search in the correspond box, and pressing **Add** (allows you to search multiple key words), only quotes with that specific key word(s) will show up after you press **Search** .

Keep in mind that the quotes can be copied by clicking them.

And that's it! You can now easily use this app. Have fun!
